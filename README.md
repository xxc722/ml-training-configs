# ML Training Config Tracking Repository
This repository is used to track changes in the training configuration files for machine learning projects. Specifically, it focuses on tracking changes to the `train_batch_size` and `eval_batch_size` parameters in the `training/configs/training_params.yaml` file.

The main goal is to analyze how changes in these batch size parameters affect the training process, especially in relation to memory - related issues. By associating parameter changes with relevant GitHub issues containing memory - related keywords, we aim to better understand and optimize the training environment.
